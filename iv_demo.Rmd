Rmarkdown to accompany teaching demonstration. Adapted from code written by Matthias Baumann to accompany Butsic, V. et al. (2017) Quasi-experimental methods enable stronger inferences from observational data in ecology. 

## Scenario
In the Sims 2010 paper, she is interested in the effect of forest protection on socioeconomic outcomes. Here, we will use a toy dataset to explore a scenario where we need to use instrumental variables rather than OLS. 

For the purposes of this exercise, we will simplify Sims's dataset. Let's say we are interested in the effect of the presence of protected forests in a locality (treatment) on average monthly household consumption (outcome). We have sampled average monthly household consumption at a set of localities, where we have also recorded data on average slope and elevation and the distance to major cities. Due to the nonrandom placement of protected areas, we suspect that there are unobserved variables that influence the placement of protected areas and socioeconomic outcomes -- we have an issue of endogeneity. In this example, the unobserved variable is the historical presence of strong local institutions.

In our simulated data, we know the true relationships between the variables, which helps us see the different results we get from analyzing the effect of forest protection on the socioeconomic outcome using OLS vs. instrumental variables. In this example, we know that there is no correlation between the presence of protected forests and unobservable covariates of average monthly household consumption.

We need an instrumental variable that is correlated with the presence of protected forests (the treatment) but that is not correlated with average monthly household consumption (the outcome) except through its relationship with the presence of protected forests. Here, whether or not the locality intersects a major tributary could be an appropriate instrument, as a proxy for priority watershed status: priority watershed status is related to the conservation objective of watershed protection, and thus is related to the placement of protected areas, but there is no other mechanism through which the distance to the nearest major tributary affects average monthly household consumption. Distance to the nearest major tributary is not correlated with the unobserved historical presence of strong local institutions.

## Simulate data
### Write function to simulate dataset
```{r, eval = TRUE}
### Write function to simulate a dataset
simulate_data <- function(){
  
  ## Create data variables within data.frame
  
  ## Make a column for observation ID
  df <- data.frame(id = seq(1, 1000),
                   
                   ## Columns for explanatory variables
                   
                   ## Treatment variable
                   forest_protect = c(rep(0,500), rep(1,500)),
                   
                   ## Other covariates
                   slope = runif(1000, min = 50, max = 100),
                   elevation = runif(1000, min = 150, max = 185),
                   dist_cities = runif(1000, min = 0, max = 250),
                   
                   ## Unobserved variable
                   local_inst = c(rep(0,100), rep(1,500), rep(0,400)),
                   
                   ## A column for the error term
                   error = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 5),
                   
                   ### And the instrumental variable
                   tributary = c(rep(0,500), rep(1,200), rep(0,300)))
  
## Make a column for the outcome variable (average monthly household consumption)  
  df$consumpt <- 1 + 5*df$forest_protect + 0.07*df$slope + 
    0.05*df$elevation + 2*df$dist_cities + 5*df$local_inst + df$error
  return(df)  
}
```

*We know that the true effect of the endogenous explanatory variable (the presence of protected forests in the locality) is a 5x increase in the response variable (the average monthly household consumption in that locality).*


## Use OLS for estimation
In each of the methods we use to estimate the effect of forest protection on socioeconomic outcomes, we will simulate the dataset 1000 times and calculate the average treatment effect across the 1000 simulations. Otherwise, we might estimate a treatment effect that differs from the true treatment effect due to random chance in a given simulated dataset.

```{r}
### Write a function to generate data and analyze using OLS 
ols_fun = function(){
  
  ## Simulate the dataset
  data <- simulate_data()
  
  ## Run OLS
  ols <- lm(consumpt ~ forest_protect + slope + elevation + 
              dist_cities, data = data)
  
  ## Extract model coefficients and standard error
  protect_coeff <- coef(summary(ols))["forest_protect", "Estimate"]
  protect_se <- coef(summary(ols))["forest_protect", "Std. Error"]
  list <- list(protect_coeff, protect_se)
}

### Apply the function on 1000 replicates
ols_sim <- replicate(1000, ols_fun())

### Extract the model estimates
ols_protect_est <- unlist(ols_sim[1, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for coefficient estimates
c(mean(ols_protect_est), sd(ols_protect_est), min(ols_protect_est), max(ols_protect_est))

### Extract the standard deviations
ols_protect_sd <- unlist(ols_sim[2, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minumum, and maximum
### standard deviation of coefficient estimates
c(mean(ols_protect_sd), sd(ols_protect_sd), min(ols_protect_sd), max(ols_protect_sd))
```

*The effect estimated by OLS is incorrect-- it should be 5.*


## Use instrumental variables for estimation
Implement instrumental variables using the two stage least-squares regression. Again, we will simulate 1000 datasets and calculate the average treatment effect.

```{r}
### Write a function to generate data and analyze using IV 
iv_tsls_fun = function(){
  
  ## Simulate the dataset
  data <- simulate_data()
  
  ## Step 1
  ## Regress the percent of protected forest on the other explanatory variables 
  ## and our instrumental variable
  tsls_step1 <- lm(forest_protect ~ slope + elevation + 
                       dist_cities + tributary, data = data)
  
  ## Extract fitted values of the percent of protected forest
  pred_value <- fitted.values(tsls_step1)
  
  ## Step 2
  ## Regress our outcome of interest on the predicted value of the treatment + 
  ## the other explanatory variables
  tsls_step2 <- lm(consumpt ~ pred_value + slope + elevation + dist_cities, 
                   data = data)
  
  ## Extract model coefficients and standard error
  iv_coeff <- coef(summary(tsls_step2))["pred_value", "Estimate"]
  iv_se <- coef(summary(tsls_step2))["pred_value", "Std. Error"]
  list <- list(iv_coeff, iv_se)
}

### Apply the function on 1000 replicates
iv_tsls_sim <- replicate(1000, iv_tsls_fun())

### Extract the model estimates
iv_tsls_est <- unlist(iv_tsls_sim[1, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for coefficient estimates
c(mean(iv_tsls_est), sd(iv_tsls_est), min(iv_tsls_est), max(iv_tsls_est))

### Extract the standard deviations
iv_tsls_est_sd <- unlist(iv_tsls_sim[2, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minumum, and maximum standard deviation 
### of coefficient estimates
c(mean(iv_tsls_est_sd), sd(iv_tsls_est_sd), min(iv_tsls_est_sd), max(iv_tsls_est_sd))
```

*This yields the expected estimate for the effect of forest protection on average monthly household consumption.*

## Compare results from OLS vs. IV
```{r}
### Make single df of model estimates
both_methods <- cbind.data.frame(ols_protect_est,
                                 iv_tsls_est)

### Reshape the data
both_methods <- both_methods %>%
  gather(method, estimate, ols_protect_est:iv_tsls_est) %>%
  mutate(method_clean = ifelse(method == "ols_protect_est", "OLS", "IV"))

### Visualize distribution of estimates
ggplot(both_methods, aes(x = method_clean, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Estimated effect of forest protection",
       x = "Estimation method") +
  
  ## Add a horizontal line indicating the actual value of the effect
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5, 
             linetype = "dashed",
             color = "red")

# ggsave("method_comparison.png")
```


## Use instrumental variables for estimation, using ARE package
The ARE package has a built-in function, IVreg that lets you implement IV in a single line of code. Again, we will simulate 1000 datasets and calculate the average treatment effect.

```{r}
### Write a function to generate data and analyze using IV
iv_fun <- function(){
  
  ## Simulate the data
  data <- simulate_data()
  
  ## Run with IV 
  IVreg <- ivreg(consumpt ~ forest_protect + slope + 
                   elevation + dist_cities | tributary + 
                   slope + elevation + dist_cities, data = data)
  
  ## Extract model coefficients and standard error
  protect_coeff <- coef(summary(IVreg))["forest_protect", "Estimate"]
  protect_se <- coef(summary(IVreg))["forest_protect", "Std. Error"]
  list <- list(protect_coeff,protect_se)
}

### Apply the IV function on 1000 replicates
iv_sim <- replicate(1000, iv_fun())

### Extract the model estimates
iv_protect_est <- unlist(iv_sim[1, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for coefficient estimates
c(mean(iv_protect_est), sd(iv_protect_est), min(iv_protect_est), max(iv_protect_est))

### Extract the standard deviations
iv_protect_sd <- unlist(iv_sim[2, ])

### Print mean, standard deviation, minumum, and maximum 
### standard deviation of coefficient estimates
c(mean(iv_protect_sd), sd(iv_protect_sd), min(iv_protect_sd), max(iv_protect_sd))
```
*Again, this yields the expected estimate for the effect of forest protection on average monthly household consumption.*
